## Requirement
1. Python 3.8.
1. Pytorch 1.4.0


### Our source code will released soon. !!!!

## UUIE dataset
UUIE dataset (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9516935) contains 4088 raw underwater images and 5629 high-quality images, and there are 50 raw underwater images and 50 high-quality images for the model test. As far as we know, the UUIE is the first public dataset dedicated to the research of weakly supervised underwater image enhancement. It is free for academic research, not for any commercial purposes.

Its folder looks like this:
